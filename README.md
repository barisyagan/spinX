The iOS Game

![Screenshot of the gamepplay](/ScreenShot.png)

This is an iOS game developed by me for my CS college course project.In game there
are two crosses one within the other and a circle which is between these smaller and 
bigger crosses and inner cross rotates while player is panning on screen. Aim is 
panning on screen and to stop at right time to make the inner cross to stop at 
right position and let it unite with the outer cross.
